# This is a conceptual example. Actual implementation will be done in Power BI Desktop.

import pandas as pd

# Load employee performance data
employee_data = pd.read_csv('employee_data.csv')

# Data preprocessing
employee_data['Sales Target Achievement'] = employee_data['Sales'] / employee_data['Sales Target']

# Visualization in Power BI
# Create bar charts and line charts to track employee performance metrics
